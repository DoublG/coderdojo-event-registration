# Data model: the redesign (rationale and plan)

Split out of `DATA_MODEL.md` §10 ("Redesign: rationale and plan") because its design history — why the old role-subclass model was replaced, the phase-by-phase plan it was built from — had grown to ~900 lines on its own, and it's now fully landed. `DATA_MODEL.md` stays the index and the current-state reference (§1–9 describe the model this redesign produced); it links here for the rationale. Section numbering below is kept as it was in `DATA_MODEL.md` so existing "§10" references elsewhere in the repo still resolve.

---

## 10. Redesign: rationale and plan

> **Status: landed** (all eight phases, 2026-09-24). Sections 1–9 are the current model; this
> section keeps *why* it looks the way it does: the problems with the old
> model, the decisions taken and the plan. Where it says "today", read
> "before the redesign".

### Nomenclature

The redesign uses CoderDojo's own vocabulary. Use these terms in the new
model, in the UI and in the docs:

| Term | Meaning | Role / entity in the redesign | Today's code (sections 1–9) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Champion** | The **dojo owner**: runs and manages a dojo. Exactly one per dojo. | membership role `champion` | `DojoOwner`, `Dojo.owner`, shown as "Lead Coach" |
| **Mentor** / **Coach** | An adult **helper** who helps manage and run a dojo. | membership role `mentor` | `HelperAccount`, `Mentor.VOLUNTEER` ("Volunteer mentor") |
| **Ninja** | A **child aged 7–17** who visits a dojo. | `NINJA` (plus an optional `NINJA_ACCOUNT` login) | `Participant` (+ `ChildAccount`) |
| **Youth mentor** | A **ninja who helps run events**. Promoted by the dojo's champion or a mentor. | membership role `youth_mentor` | `Mentor.CHAMPION` / `Mentor.NINJA` linked to a `ChildAccount` |
| **Badge** | An **award** a ninja can achieve: either a one-off ("did the thing") or a **milestone** reached by a count (e.g. the attendance wristbands). | `BADGE` (kind `one_off` / `milestone`) / `NINJA_BADGE` | `BadgeAward` and `MilestoneAward` / `ParticipantAward` |
| **Belt** | A ninja's **proficiency level**: how skilled they are, not how often they came. | `BELT` / `NINJA_BELT` | nothing today. A milestone award *can* be set up to grant a belt, but doesn't have to. |

Watch out for two collisions with today's code:

- **"Champion"** changes meaning. Today `Mentor.CHAMPION` ("Dojo
  champion") is an honoured *ninja*. In the redesign a **Champion is the
  dojo owner**, and the honoured-ninja role is a **Youth mentor**.
- **"Mentor"** today is the name of the team-page *profile table*
  (`dojos.Mentor`), which the redesign removes. In the redesign
  **mentor** is only a *role* (an adult helper) on a dojo membership.

### What's wrong with the current model

- **`Mentor` shouldn't be a table of its own.** Today it's a copy of a
  person (name, email, photo) with up to four optional links back to the
  real account (`owner_account`, `helper_account`, `guardian_account`,
  `child_account`). That's why `Mentor.clean()` needs "at most one link"
  rules and `Dojo.sync_lead_coach()` exists to keep the Lead Coach copy in
  step with `Dojo.owner`. What the site actually needs is a way to show
  **the team working at a dojo**: the accounts involved and each one's role
  there.
- **Champion and mentor aren't kinds of account.** They describe how a
  person relates to one particular dojo, and a person can have that
  relationship with several dojos. Modelling them as account subclasses
  (`DojoOwner`, `HelperAccount`), plus `Dojo.owner` and
  `Mentor.helper_account`, spreads one idea across three places.
- **Background checks belong to the person.** The check fields already
  live on `accounts.User`, but whether a check is required depends on which
  role subclasses an account has, and the check itself is tracked on the
  applications. In the new model the check is tracked on the account, and
  it's required by the **relationship**: holding a `champion` or `mentor`
  membership needs a valid check, while plain use of the site doesn't.

### Target model

**Two account types only:**

- **`NINJA_ACCOUNT`**: a ninja's own login. **No background check.** A
  ninja can be promoted to **Youth mentor** at a dojo by that dojo's
  champion or one of its mentors. Created and removed by the child's
  guardian (§17).
- **Account** (the normal, adult account; what `User` is today, minus the
  role subclasses). Every account *can* go through the background-check
  process (`BackgroundCheckMixin`'s lifecycle, tracked on the account
  itself), but it's **only required to become a champion or a mentor**
  *(decided)*. A parent using the site normally (registering their family,
  managing their ninjas, signing them up for sessions) never needs a
  check. Holding a `champion` or `mentor` membership requires a validated,
  unexpired check. Every decision on a check is also written to an audit
  history of who approved or rejected it, and when.

**The team is a relation between an account and a dojo.** Champion,
mentor and youth-mentor roles are all stored on one relation row per
account and dojo (below called `DojoMembership`; the name isn't decided).
One account can be linked to any number of dojos, with the role that fits
each relationship.

> **Historical.** This is the design as it was planned, kept as the record of why the
> model looks the way it does. It still uses the plan's names (`ACCOUNT` and `NINJA_ACCOUNT`,
> which became one `User` table with an `account_type`). The model as built is in sections 2–9.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ACCOUNT ||--o{ DOJO_MEMBERSHIP : "champion / mentor at"
    NINJA_ACCOUNT ||--o{ DOJO_MEMBERSHIP : "youth mentor at"
    DOJO ||--o{ DOJO_MEMBERSHIP : "team"
    ACCOUNT |o--o{ DOJO_MEMBERSHIP : "promoted_by (youth mentors)"

    ACCOUNT {
        bigint id PK
        string username
        string email
        string background_check_status "required only for champions and mentors"
        datetime background_check_expires_at "lapsed = no dojo-team access"
    }
    NINJA_ACCOUNT {
        bigint id PK
        string username
        string note "no background check"
    }
    DOJO_MEMBERSHIP {
        bigint id PK
        bigint dojo_id FK
        bigint account_id FK "a normal account, or"
        bigint ninja_account_id FK "a ninja account (youth mentors only)"
        string role "champion, mentor, youth_mentor"
        string status "requested, active, dormant (see Lifecycles)"
        bigint promoted_by_id FK "youth mentor only: the champion/mentor who promoted them"
    }
```

Rules the new model needs to enforce:

| Role | Who can hold it | How it's granted |
|---|---|---|
| `champion` | normal account, **approved as a champion**, with a valid background check | creating a dojo (the creator becomes its champion), or a **transfer** from the current champion |
| `mentor` | normal account, **approved as a mentor**, with a valid background check | the mentor **requests to join** and an active champion/mentor of that dojo accepts, **or** an active champion/mentor **adds** them |
| `youth_mentor` | ninja account | promoted by an active `champion` or `mentor` of **the same dojo** |

"Approved as a mentor" and "approved as a champion" are **account-level,
one-time** approvals (an application plus a background check; see
Lifecycles below). They aren't tied to a dojo: once approved, a mentor can
join as many dojos as accept them, and a champion can create a dojo.

- A membership links exactly one of `account` / `ninja_account`, and the
  role has to match the account type (`youth_mentor` only on ninja
  accounts; `champion`/`mentor` only on normal accounts).
- There's one membership per (account, dojo). Leaving and rejoining reuses
  the same row (dormant → active again) rather than adding a second one.
- **Exactly one active `champion` per dojo.** It changes hands only by
  transfer (below), never by having two champions at once.
- `promoted_by` must hold a `champion` or `mentor` membership at that same
  dojo.
- The team page lists a dojo's `active` memberships whose account has
  `show_on_team_pages` set, the champion first, using the account's shared
  profile. That covers what `Mentor.objects.lead_coach_first()` does
  today; the "Lead Coach" label becomes **Champion**.
- Admin access (`dojos/access.py`) reads the role from the membership, and
  only an **`active`** membership whose account has a valid check grants
  access to that dojo's dashboard. The role→capability mapping
  (`ROLE_CAPABILITIES`) already works this way; today's `OWNER`/`HELPER`
  become `CHAMPION`/`MENTOR`, plus a `YOUTH_MENTOR` entry, probably with no
  admin capabilities.

### Lifecycles

#### Becoming a mentor or champion, then joining a dojo

Approval happens **once per account**, not once per dojo. Joining a
specific dojo's team is a separate, lightweight step handled by that
dojo's own team, with no admin involved.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Normal account] --> B["Applies: mentor / champion<br/>(APPLICATION)"]
    B --> C[Background check on the account]
    C --> D{Reviewer approves?}
    D -- no --> X[Rejected]
    D -- yes --> E{Kind}
    E -- mentor --> H[Approved mentor]
    E -- champion --> S[Approved champion]

    H --> J1["Requests to join a dojo<br/>(membership: requested)"]
    J1 --> J2{"Active champion/mentor<br/>of that dojo accepts?"}
    J2 -- yes --> ACT["Membership: active<br/>→ dashboard access for that dojo"]
    J2 -- no --> DEC[Request declined]
    H -. "or an active champion/mentor<br/>adds them directly" .-> ACT

    S --> N["Creates a dojo<br/>(dojo: draft, membership: champion, active)"]
    N --> ACT
```

#### Dojo lifecycle

A new dojo starts in `draft`. The draft is where the champion sets up the
profile, team and first sessions before anything is public.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft : created by an approved champion
    draft --> active : champion launches it (no approval needed)
    active --> dormant : no active events left
    dormant --> active : restarts
    active --> archived : closed (no active events left)
    dormant --> archived : closed
    archived --> draft : reopened (archiving isn't final)

    draft : draft<br/>hidden from the public site<br/>team can set it up
    active : active<br/>public, runs sessions, accepts join requests
    dormant : dormant<br/>not on the public site<br/>still in ninjas' history
    archived : archived<br/>not on the public site<br/>still in ninjas' history
```

Decided rules:

- **Launching:** the champion moves a dojo from `draft` to `active`
  themselves. No admin approval is needed; they were already approved as
  a champion.
- **Going dormant or archived:** only allowed when the dojo has **no active
  events**, meaning no upcoming event that's still `draft` or `open`. The
  transition is refused while an active event exists; the team has to
  close or finish those first. In practice a dojo goes dormant when
  nothing has been planned for a long time.
- **Pending join requests** (`requested` memberships) are **declined
  automatically** when a dojo goes dormant or is archived, and the
  requesting mentors are notified.
- **Dormancy is a manual decision, with a nudge.** The site never makes a
  dojo dormant by itself. Once an `active` dojo has had **no events planned
  for half a year** (six months since its last event, with nothing
  upcoming), its dashboard flags it, and the dojo's active team (champion
  and mentors) and the **board** (`ORGANISATION_ROLE`) get a **persistent**
  notification. It stays visible until the situation is resolved, either
  because an event is planned or because the dojo is marked dormant or
  archived, rather than being sent once or repeated. The board sees these
  on a **board dashboard that hasn't been built yet**.
  - Model note: "persistent until resolved" doesn't fit today's
    `Notification`, which is a one-off message with `read`. Either give it
    a `resolved_at` (plus a key such as `kind` + `dojo`, so the alert isn't
    duplicated), or compute the alert from the data (last event date +
    status) every time the dashboards render. Decide when the board
    dashboard is built.
- **Visibility:** `dormant` and `archived` dojos **don't appear on the
  public site** (dojo finder, dojo pages, upcoming sessions). They
  **still appear in ninjas' own history**: past sessions, registrations,
  badges and belts keep showing the dojo's name for the ninjas and parents
  concerned.
- **Archiving isn't final:** an archived dojo can be reopened. It goes
  **back to `draft`**, hidden from the public site, so the team can check
  its profile and team before launching it again.
- **Team powers:** any **active** mentor can do what the champion can for
  team management: accept join requests, add mentors directly, and
  promote ninjas to youth mentor. Only the champion can transfer the
  champion role.

#### Team membership lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> requested : approved mentor asks to join
    [*] --> active : added by a champion/mentor,<br/>or creator of the dojo (champion)
    requested --> active : accepted by a champion/mentor
    requested --> [*] : declined / withdrawn,<br/>or auto-declined when the dojo<br/>goes dormant or is archived
    active --> dormant : leaves the dojo
    dormant --> active : rejoins (request accepted or re-added)

    requested : requested<br/>no access yet
    active : active<br/>dashboard access, on the team page
    dormant : dormant<br/>no access, not on the team page,<br/>still shown on past events' teams
```

- **Leaving:** a mentor (or youth mentor) can leave a dojo at any time.
  Their membership becomes `dormant`. It isn't deleted, so it still
  appears on the **event team** of the past sessions they helped run, but
  it's no longer on the team page and gives no dashboard access.
- **Champion transfer:** the active champion can hand the champion role to
  one of the dojo's **active mentors**. In one step, the chosen mentor's
  membership becomes `champion` and the previous champion's becomes
  `mentor` (still active; they can then leave like any other mentor). The
  target must be an active mentor at that dojo with a valid check. A
  champion can't simply leave: they transfer the role first, or the dojo
  is archived.
- **Checks lapsing:** when an account's background check lapses, all its
  `champion`/`mentor` memberships stop granting access until it's renewed.
  Their status doesn't change: they're still `active`, just not usable.

### Pathways move to the dojo and event scope

Today a pathway is linked only per ninja, per session, and only one
(`Registration.pathway`: "what this child worked on"). In the redesign
pathways are set at three levels, each one **pre-filled from the level
above**:

- **Dojo ↔ pathway** (many-to-many, optional): the pathways a dojo
  **provides** as a service, for example "we do Scratch and micro:bit".
- **Event ↔ pathway** (many-to-many, optional): the pathways a specific
  **session** covers. Pre-filled from the dojo's.
- **Registration ↔ pathway** (many-to-many, optional): the pathways **this
  ninja** works on at that session, often a **subset** of the event's.
  Pre-filled from the event's. This replaces today's single
  `Registration.pathway`.
- All three are **optional**. A dojo, event or registration without
  pathways is perfectly valid.
- When set, an event's pathways are **shown on its public event details
  page**, and a dojo's can be shown on its dojo page. A registration's
  pathways feed the ninja's own history and the attendance list.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    DOJO }o--o{ PATHWAY : "provides (DOJO_PATHWAY, optional)"
    EVENT }o--o{ PATHWAY : "covers (EVENT_PATHWAY, optional)"
    DOJO ||--o{ EVENT : "runs"
    EVENT ||--o{ REGISTRATION : "registrations"
    REGISTRATION }o--o{ PATHWAY : "works on (REGISTRATION_PATHWAY, optional)"
    PATHWAY ||--o{ PATHWAY_STEP : "steps"
    PATHWAY ||--o{ PATHWAY_PROJECT : "projects"
    PATHWAY }o--o{ SKILL : "skills"
```

Decided:

- **Event pathways default to the dojo's but aren't restricted.** The
  event form pre-selects the pathways the dojo provides, and the team can
  add or remove any pathway for that particular session.
- **Registration pathways work the same way, one level down.** A new
  registration pre-selects the event's pathways, and they can be narrowed
  to the subset this ninja actually works on (or changed), without a hard
  restriction. The ninja's history and the attendance list read the
  **registration's** pathways.

### Mapping from today's model

| Today | In the redesign |
|---|---|
| `accounts.User` | the normal **Account** |
| `DojoOwner`, `HelperAccount` (MTI subclasses) | removed: a `champion` / `mentor` membership on the account |
| `Guardian` (MTI subclass) | removed: a normal account with `GUARDIANSHIP` rows to its ninjas (no check needed for that) |
| `ChildAccount` | `NINJA_ACCOUNT`: the second account type |
| `Participant` | `NINJA` |
| `Dojo.owner` | a `champion` membership |
| `Mentor` (with a dojo) | removed: the relationship becomes a membership, and the display fields move onto the account's shared profile |
| `Mentor` with no dojo (role `board`) | an `ORGANISATION_TEAM_MEMBER` row (display only, for the organisation's team details page) with position "Member of the board", maintained from the management dashboard |
| `Mentor.owner_account` / `helper_account` | the membership's `account` (role `champion` / `mentor`) |
| `Mentor.child_account` + role `champion`/`ninja` | a `youth_mentor` membership with `promoted_by` |
| "Lead Coach" label | **Champion** |
| `Dojo.sync_lead_coach()` (and its demote-on-owner-change) | removed: the champion role changes by an explicit **transfer** between memberships (the old champion becomes a mentor) |
| `DojoApplication` / `MentorApplication` (per dojo, creating the account and role) | one `APPLICATION` per account and kind (`mentor`, `champion`). Approval makes the account an approved mentor or champion; joining or creating a dojo is a separate step |
| `Dojo` (no status; always public) | `Dojo.status`: `draft`, `active`, `dormant`, `archived` |
| `Registration.pathway` (one per ninja, per session) | many-to-many at three levels, each pre-filled from the one above: **dojo** (`DOJO_PATHWAY`) → **event** (`EVENT_PATHWAY`, shown on the event details page) → **registration** (`REGISTRATION_PATHWAY`, the ninja's subset) |
| `Award` → `BadgeAward` / `MilestoneAward`, `ParticipantAward` | **Badges** (`BADGE` with kind `one_off` / `milestone`, `NINJA_BADGE`); milestones stay badges. **Belts** (`BELT`, `NINJA_BELT`) are new: a ninja's proficiency level |
| `dojos.access` roles `OWNER` / `HELPER` | `CHAMPION` / `MENTOR` (+ `YOUTH_MENTOR`) |
| background-check fields on the applications, and on `User` for owner/helper | the current check on every normal account, plus an append-only `BACKGROUND_CHECK_HISTORY` audit log (who decided, when) |

### Open questions to settle before starting

- ~~**Parents.**~~ *Decided: no check for normal use of the site; a
  check is required only to become a champion or mentor. See (A) below.*
- ~~**Ninja vs ninja account**~~: *decided, see (B) below.* They stay
  separate.
- ~~**Organisation team members** (today's board members)~~: *decided,
  see (C) below.* The public listing is separate from accounts and
  access.
- ~~**Team-page profile fields**~~: *decided, see (D) below.* One shared
  profile on the account.
- ~~**History**~~: *not an issue in the new model.* Memberships are never
  deleted, only made `dormant`, and `EVENT.event_team` points at them. The
  membership table therefore *is* the history, and "who ran this session"
  is a plain lookup there. There's no legacy history to carry over either;
  see "No data migration" below.
- ~~**Belts: progress in what?**~~ *Decided: a belt is a ninja's
  **proficiency level**, not an attendance count.* Milestone awards (like
  the attendance wristbands) stay **badges** (kind `milestone`). A
  milestone badge *can* be configured to also grant a belt
  (`BADGE.grants_belt`), but doesn't have to.
- ~~**Belts: how are they stored and shown?**~~ *Decided:* `NINJA_BELT` is
  a **history table**: one row per belt a ninja reaches (when, and awarded
  by whom), appended and never overwritten. A ninja's **current
  proficiency** is their highest-level belt in that history. It's shown in
  two places:
  - the **ninja's account details page** (for the ninja and their
    parents): the current belt plus the history of earlier belts;
  - the **management tooling**: the dojo dashboard for its champion and
    mentors (who can also award belts there), and the organisation's
    management dashboards (read-only), to see a ninja's level and
    progression over time.

  The belt is the *only* record of a ninja's coding level: the old
  self-reported `experience_level` on `NINJA` (new / some / confident,
  asked at family sign-up) was removed, and the current belt is shown
  wherever that level needs to be visible (the ninja's page, the family
  page's child cards, the attendance list and the ninja admin list).
- ~~**Belts: remaining details.**~~ *Decided:*
  - **Belts aren't connected to pathways (yet).** A belt is one overall
    proficiency level per ninja, a single track of levels. Linking belts to
    pathways (e.g. a Scratch belt and a Python belt) is possible future
    work, not part of this redesign.
  - **Only people who actively manage a dojo can award a belt:** an
    account with an **active** `champion` or `mentor` membership (a new
    `AWARD_BELTS` capability, granted to `CHAMPION` and `MENTOR` like the
    others). Organisation accounts (`ORGANISATION_ROLE`) **can't** award
    belts through the management dashboards; they can only see them. Each
    history row records **who** awarded the belt (`awarded_by`, the
    account) **and in which role** (`awarded_as_membership`, their
    champion/mentor membership at that dojo; required). So the history can
    show "awarded by Jan, as mentor of Dojo Ghent".

Lifecycle questions. These are *decided*, and the rules are under
"Dojo lifecycle" above:

- ~~Launching a dojo~~: the champion launches it; no approval.
- ~~Who can accept join requests~~: any active mentor, as well as the
  champion. The same goes for adding mentors and promoting youth mentors.
- ~~Dormant/archived visibility~~: hidden from the public site, still in
  ninjas' history. Archived can be reopened.
- ~~Going dormant or archived with open events~~: not allowed; both
  require no active events.
- ~~Pending join requests~~: declined automatically on dormant or
  archived.
- ~~Reopening an archived dojo~~: back to `draft`.
- ~~Detecting dormancy~~: manual, with a dashboard flag and notifications
  to the team and the board.
- ~~The "no events planned" period~~: half a year. The notification is
  persistent until resolved and appears on the future board dashboard.

Still open: nothing in the lifecycles. The **board dashboard** itself is
future work that needs its own design.

Pathways (`Pathway`, `PathwayStep`, `PathwayProject`, `Skill`), the
`content` models and the geo reference data stay as they are today
(sections 7 and 9), so they're only shown where they connect. Awards are
renamed into badges and belts (see Nomenclature).

**Decisions in this draft:**

- **(A) Parents — decided.** A parent is a normal `ACCOUNT` linked to
  their ninjas through `GUARDIANSHIP` (which replaces the `Guardian`
  subclass and `Participant.guardian`). **Normal use of the website needs
  no background check:** signing up, registering and managing their
  ninjas, and signing them up for sessions all work straight away, as the
  self-service guardian sign-up does today. The check becomes a
  requirement only when the same account wants to become a **champion**
  (start a dojo) or a **mentor** (help at one). The account applies,
  completes the check, and gets the membership once it's validated. A
  lapsed check removes team access (as login blocking does for
  owners/helpers today) but never the parent's own use of the site.
- **(B) Ninja vs ninja account — decided.** They stay separate. A `NINJA`
  is the child as a person (always present); a `NINJA_ACCOUNT` is an
  optional login attached to it. Youth mentors are memberships of the
  `NINJA_ACCOUNT`, since a youth mentor needs to be able to log in.
- **(C) Organisation team members — decided.** **Being listed** and
  **having access** are two separate things:
  - **`ORGANISATION_TEAM_MEMBER`** is display only. It's used **only for
    the organisation's team details page**: the people shown there, each
    with a **position** (name, position, bio, photo, focus areas, order).
    "Member of the board" is one possible position, not a separate kind of
    person. Not everyone listed needs an account; the link to an `ACCOUNT`
    is optional and only for convenience.
  - **`ORGANISATION_ROLE`** is access: the accounts that can use the
    organisation's **management dashboards** (including the future board
    dashboard). Not everyone with access has to be listed.
  - There's **no self-service** for the listing. People with
    management-dashboard access maintain `ORGANISATION_TEAM_MEMBER` for
    everyone.
- **(D) Team-page profile — decided.** To keep it simple, the profile
  (display name, title, bio, photo, whether to show it) lives on the
  **account** and is **shared across every dojo** the person is on. The
  membership only carries the relationship (role, status, dates). A youth
  mentor's profile lives on their `NINJA_ACCOUNT` the same way.
- **(E) History — decided.** Leaving a dojo makes a membership
  **`dormant`**, never deleted. `EVENT.event_team` points at memberships,
  so past sessions keep showing who ran them after someone leaves. Only
  `active` memberships grant dashboard access or appear on the team page.
  An archived dojo keeps all its memberships and events as read-only
  history.
- **(F) Background checks — decided.** The **current** check lives on the
  account (status, token, document, expiry), moved there from the
  applications. Each time a reviewer validates or rejects a check, a row
  is appended to `BACKGROUND_CHECK_HISTORY`: whose check, the decision,
  **who reviewed it and when**, and the expiry it set. The history is an
  audit log only. It's append-only and never edited, and nothing reads it
  to decide access; the fields on the account do that. A renewal resets
  the account's current check and adds a new history row when it's
  decided, so earlier decisions stay on record. "Delete the document,
  keep only the decision" still holds: the uploaded document is deleted
  once decided, and the history never stores it. Applications merge into
  one `APPLICATION` table with a `kind`, since both kinds now just grant a
  membership, and approving one requires the applicant's account to have
  a valid check.

### No data migration: adapt the seeders

**No data-migration logic is needed.** The current database contains only
**seeded test data** (`.devcontainer/start.sh` runs the `seed_*` commands
on a fresh database); there's no real data to preserve. So the redesign
needs no backfills, no `RunPython` conversions and no legacy-row handling.
Instead:

- Replace the models and generate fresh migrations for the affected apps.
  Squashing or resetting the old ones is fine, since dev databases are
  simply recreated.
- **Adapt the seed commands** so they produce the new model directly.
  Rebuild with `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down -v`
  followed by a fresh `up` (`start.sh` reseeds on an empty database).
  Note that `-v` also wipes the `claude-config` volume (Claude Code's
  login and sessions); to reset only the database, remove just the
  `db-data-8.4` volume (`docker volume ls` shows its project-prefixed name), or
  drop and recreate the `coolregistration` database from inside the
  workspace and rerun `start.sh`'s seed sequence.

Seeders to adapt:

| Seeder | Today | In the redesign |
|---|---|---|
| `seed_dojos` | dojos from the bundled JSON | same, plus a `status` (mostly `active`, a few `draft`/`dormant`/`archived` to exercise the lifecycle); each dojo's provided pathways are set by `seed_events`, which runs after `seed_pathways` |
| `seed_champions` (was `seed_dojo_owners`) | a `DojoOwner` per dojo | **champion** accounts (with a validated check and a `BACKGROUND_CHECK_HISTORY` row) + a `champion` membership per dojo; replaces `seed_dojo_owners` |
| `seed_mentors` | `Mentor` profiles (mostly login-less) + board rows | **mentor** accounts (validated check) with `active` memberships, some at several dojos, a few `requested`/`dormant`; **youth mentor** memberships on ninja accounts (with `promoted_by`); `ORGANISATION_TEAM_MEMBER` rows (position "Member of the board", ...) and a few `ORGANISATION_ROLE` accounts |
| `seed_guardians` | `Guardian` accounts + `Participant` children (+ optional `ChildAccount`) | **parent** accounts (no check needed) + `GUARDIANSHIP` + **ninjas** aged 7–17 (+ optional ninja accounts) |
| `seed_events` | upcoming events per dojo | same, plus **event pathways** (pre-filled from the dojo's) and an **event team** of memberships |
| `seed_ninja_history` (was `seed_participant_history`) | past events, registrations, awards | past events with event teams, registrations with **registration pathways**, **badges** (one-off and milestone) and a **belt history** awarded by champion/mentor memberships |
| *(new)* `seed_upcoming_registrations` | none | registrations for upcoming sessions at the home dojo and nearby dojos, and three sessions filled to test the **waiting list** |
| `seed_pathways`, `seed_faqs`, `seed_testimonials`, `seed_geo` | unchanged | unchanged (FAQs keep their dojo/event/pathway scoping) |
| *(new)* applications | none | a few `APPLICATION` rows (`mentor`/`champion`, pending/approved/rejected) to exercise the approval flow |

`seed_credentials.csv` keeps listing every seeded login (champions,
mentors, parents, ninja accounts).

### Implementation plan

**Status: done** (2026-09-24, on the `redesign/data-model` branch). All
phases are ticked off below.

#### Implementation decisions

These settle details the diagrams above leave open:

1. **One user table.** Normal and ninja accounts are both
   `accounts.User` (still `AUTH_USER_MODEL`), told apart by
   `User.account_type` (`adult` / `ninja`). There are no role subclasses
   any more. Where the diagrams show `ACCOUNT` / `NINJA_ACCOUNT` as two
   tables, read one `User` table with a type: memberships, belt awards and
   notifications each need a single user link, and login stays exactly as
   it is.
2. **Applying requires being logged in.** An `Application` always belongs
   to an existing account, so the anonymous "start a dojo" / "become a
   mentor" forms go away. Visitors sign up first.
3. **URLs change.** `/guardian/<id>/…` becomes `/account/…` (the family
   page), and the pages for a parent's ninjas live under it.
4. **Management dashboards = Django admin, for now.** `ORGANISATION_ROLE`
   maps to staff status plus a group. The board dashboard is future work.
5. **Dormancy nudge** (six months with no events): computed when the dojo
   dashboard loads and shown as a banner, not stored as notifications,
   until the board dashboard exists.
6. **Non-`active` dojos** (draft, dormant, archived) are hidden from the
   public site **together with their events**.

#### Approach

Work on the feature branch in three stages, keeping the test suite green
at every step:

- **A:** add the new models alongside the old ones.
- **B:** switch features over one at a time.
- **C:** remove the old models, reset the migrations to a fresh `0001`
  per app (no data to keep; see "No data migration"), and apply the new
  names.

#### Phases

- [x] **1. Accounts** (`accounts`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - `User.account_type` (`adult` / `ninja`) and `User.phone`.
  - `Guardianship` (parent account ↔ `Participant`; a ninja can have
    several guardians). `Participant.account` now points at a ninja-type
    `User`.
  - Dropped `Guardian`, `ChildAccount`, `Participant.guardian` and
    `link_guardian_role`; any adult account adds children from its account
    page.
  - Family page and ninja pages moved under `/account/`
    (`account_home`, `ninja_detail`, `edit_ninja`, `ninja_awards`,
    `add_ninja`). A ninja's own login sees its own page read-only. Menu,
    context processor, event signup and seeder updated.
  - *Moved to later phases, where they're first used:* the check fields
    on the account and `BackgroundCheckHistory` → phase 3 (together with
    the check flow; the "check gates team access, not login" change too),
    the shared team-page profile → phase 2, and `Participant` → `Ninja`
    (7–17) → phase 7 (naming). `DojoOwner` / `HelperAccount` /
    `attach_role` stay until phases 2–3 replace them.
- [x] **2. Dojo team** (`dojos`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - `DojoMembership`, `Dojo.status` and `Dojo.created_by`, plus the shared
    team-page profile on `User` (moved here from phase 1); drop
    `Dojo.owner`, `Mentor` and `sync_lead_coach()`.
  - `dojos/access.py` reads active memberships with a valid check. Roles
    become `CHAMPION` / `MENTOR` / `YOUTH_MENTOR`; new capabilities are
    `MANAGE_TEAM`, `AWARD_BELTS` and `MANAGE_LIFECYCLE`, and the champion
    transfer is champion-only.
  - The "Helpers & Mentors" admin page: team list, requests, add, promote,
    leave and transfer.
  - Dojo lifecycle actions and their rules; public querysets show active
    dojos only.
  - Team pages built from memberships; `Event.mentors` → `Event.team`.
  - *Pulled forward from phase 6:* `OrganisationTeamMember` (in the
    `content` app) replaces the board `Mentor` rows, so the homepage's
    "Meet the team" keeps working without `Mentor`.
  - *Interim, until phase 3:* "approved mentor" (who may join or be
    added) = holding the `HelperAccount` / `DojoOwner` role
    (`access.is_approved_mentor`); approving a `MentorApplication` that
    names a dojo files a join request there. Lifecycle actions are
    champion-only (`MANAGE_LIFECYCLE`).
- [x] **3. Onboarding** (`applications`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - A single `Application` (`mentor` / `champion`) on the account; the
    check fields, flow and `BackgroundCheckHistory` on the account (moved
    here from phase 1); the check stops blocking login and only gates
    dojo-team access.
  - "Create dojo" for approved champions (the dojo starts as a draft);
    "Request to join" for approved mentors.
  - Emails, renewal and admin actions reworked.
  - Also: `DojoOwner` / `HelperAccount`, `provision_account` / `attach_role`
    and `BackgroundCheckMiddleware` removed (accounts exist before applying,
    so no more emailed temporary passwords); `background_check_required`
    dropped (`background_check_valid` = validated and unexpired); the
    private document storage is referenced through a callable so migrations
    don't embed a machine-specific path; `seed_applications` added.
- [x] **4. Pathways** (`dojos`, `events`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - `Dojo.pathways`, `Event.pathways` and `Registration.pathways`
    (many-to-many, optional); `Registration.pathway` dropped.
  - Dojo settings pick the dojo's pathways; a new event pre-selects them;
    signup copies the event's onto each registration; the attendance
    list's per-row **Pathways** picker narrows them
    (`dojo_event_registration_pathways`, `TAKE_ATTENDANCE`).
  - Shown on the public dojo and event pages, the attendance list and the
    ninja's history. Seeders give dojos, events and registrations
    pathways.
- [x] **5. Badges and belts** (`events`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - `Badge` (one-off / milestone, optional `grants_belt`), `NinjaBadge`,
    `Belt` and the append-only `NinjaBelt` history (awarding account,
    membership, and the membership's role at the time, snapshotted so a
    later champion handover doesn't rewrite it). `Award` /
    `MilestoneAward` / `BadgeAward` / `ParticipantAward` removed.
  - Rules in `events/awards.py`: `award_belt` (active champion/mentor
    with a valid check, ninja has been to that dojo, only a higher belt)
    and `sync_milestones` (milestones follow attendance marks, and a
    `grants_belt` milestone awards its belt as the marker's membership).
  - "Award belt" on each attendance row (`dojo_event_award_belt`,
    `AWARD_BELTS`), which also shows the ninja's current belt; current
    belt and history on the ninja page; the awards carousel is now
    "Badges" (`ninja_badges`). Seeder adds the belt track and a belt
    history.
- [x] **6. Organisation** (`accounts`), *done 2026-09-24*
  - `OrganisationRole` (`board` / `admin`, unique per account and role;
    adult accounts only). `accounts/organisation.py` maps each role to a
    permission group and keeps `is_staff` plus the groups in sync through
    signals; losing the last role only drops staff status when nothing
    else needs it. Granted from the user's admin page (inline) or the
    role's own admin list.
  - The menu's **Organisation** link (`user_has_organisation_role`) opens
    the Django admin. Application admin actions now need change
    permission, so view-only roles can't approve/reject.
  - `seed_mentors` gives two listed board members a login with a role.
  - *Still future work:* the board dashboard, and with it the board's
    dormancy notifications (decision 5). `OrganisationTeamMember` and its
    team page landed in phase 2.
- [x] **7. Names and docs**, *done 2026-09-24*
  - `Participant` → `Ninja` (model, the `ninja` links on `Registration`,
    `NinjaBadge` and `NinjaBelt`, `Event.ninjas`, `Dojo.home_ninjas`),
    via rename migrations. The 7–17 rule (`ninja_birth_date_error`) is
    checked by `Ninja.clean()` and the family sign-up / add / edit forms
    whenever a date of birth is entered or changed (a ninja who has since
    turned 18 stays editable); `seed_guardians` gives ninjas a 7–17 date
    of birth.
  - Remaining old names in the UI and help centre (EN/FR/NL) replaced
    ("lead coach", "dojo owner"). Parent-facing pages keep saying
    "child", which is what a parent calls them.
  - This document's sections 1–9 describe the redesigned model; §10 is now
    the rationale and plan. CLAUDE.md's architecture section updated.
- [x] **8. Seeders and reset**, *done 2026-09-24*
  - Seeders as in the table above: `seed_dojo_owners` → `seed_champions`
    and `seed_participant_history` → `seed_ninja_history` (`start.sh`
    updated); `seed_dojos` makes the last three dojos draft / dormant /
    archived, and the later seeders give those no upcoming sessions (a
    draft one no history either); `seed_events` gives each session a
    team (champion plus up to two mentors, `assign_event_team`), and
    belts are awarded by a session's champion or mentor. Every seeder is
    rerun-safe: choices made only for new rows use their own RNG, so a
    rerun creates nothing.
  - Migrations reset to a fresh initial set for `accounts`,
    `applications`, `content`, `dojos`, `events` and `notifications`
    (`geo` and `pathways` were untouched by the redesign and keep their
    `0001`). Cross-app foreign keys split some apps' initial migration in
    two or three. **An existing dev database has to be recreated**
    after pulling this (see "No data migration" above).
  - Verified by a fresh migrate plus the full `start.sh` seed sequence
    on an empty database (twice, to check reruns), the full test suite,
    and a smoke test of the public, parent, champion and organisation
    pages. Not verified: a `docker compose down -v` rebuild itself (no
    Docker CLI inside the workspace; this was done as a database-only
    reset instead).
